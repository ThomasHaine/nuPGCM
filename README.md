This Julia code solves the 3D (non-hydrostatic) planetary geostrophic (PG) equations using finite elements.

If you are looking for the 1D and 2D PG models from [Peterson & Callies (2022)](https://doi.org/10.1175/JPO-D-21-0173.1) and [Peterson & Callies (2023)](https://doi.org/10.1175/JPO-D-22-0082.1), please check out the [PGModels1Dand2D](https://github.com/hgpeterson/PGModels1Dand2D) repository.
